            <p>SpendHQ is an all-in-one spend intelligence dashboard web app for Fortune 500 companies. It helps them see where their money is going by connecting all of their suppliers and related third-party software. It also uses AI to recategorize and rename their data.</p>
            <p>SpendHQ had no professional designer before I joined the team. It was my job to lead and design the user experience and interface according to modern design standards.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>

            <p>When I joined the team, the product owner, (who started around the same time as I did), and I sat with major clients, including Pepsi and Under Armour, to understand their current likes and dislikes with the existing product.</p>
            <p>One of these user interview sessions revealed several pain points in a major feature called the power filter. After redesigning this feature, we saw massive improvements in user feedback and time to completion of major goals.</p>
            <p>Along with the product owner, we established four main user personas, encapsulating high- to low-level financial analysts with varied technical aptitudes.</p>
            <p>When we joined, there were no existing analytics tools. We selected HotJar and Pendo to view heatmaps, user behavior recordings, contextual feedback, surveys, key metric recordings (session time, stickiness, churn, and NPS scores), and to track each behavior step through their experiences. We worked with development to make integration happen.</p>

            <h2>UX Design</h2>

            <p>There were no existing processes or tools in place for this portion of the design process. Bringing FigJam into the picture allowed us to map user flows per persona, enabling the product owner, stakeholders, business intelligence, and developers to collaborate with us in real time. This gave us massive time savings as it eliminated a lot of previous back and forth.</p>
            <p>Leveraging FigJam to wireframe component and screen states, also yielded the same time savings thanks to real-time collaboration. Completion and sign-off of wireframes, before hi-fi creation or actual development, also provided massive time savings.</p>

            <h2>UI Design</h2>

            <p>The existing design system was incomplete; there was only a basic document that detailed spacing, typography, coloration, and basic styling for components. I designed a whole new design system composed of an atomic design structure.</p>
            <p>There were no design files to work from when I was hired, so drawing and re-skinning the entire app in Figma was also an accomplishment during my time here. The app included over 200 screens.</p>
            <p>Prototyping the hi-fi mockups allowed me to provide user testing groups, developers, and stakeholders with the opportunity to test the actual design before any development occurred, thereby saving resources and time.</p>
