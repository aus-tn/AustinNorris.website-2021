            <p>SpendHQ is an all in one spend intelligence dashboard web app, for Fortune 500 companies. It helps them
                see
                where their money is going, by connecting all of their suppliers and related third party software. It
                also uses
                AI to re-categorize and re-name their data for them.</p>
            <p>SpendHQ had no professional designer before I joined the team. It was my job to lead and design the user
                experience and interface to modern design standards.</p>

            <p>When I was brought onto the team, the product owner (who started around the same time as myself) and I
                sat with
                major clients including Pepsi and Under Armour to understand their current likes and dislikes with the
                existing
                product.</p>
            <p>One of these <strong>user interview sessions</strong> revealed several pain points in a major feature
                called
                the power filter. After redesigning this feature we saw massive improvements in user feed back and time
                to
                completion of major goals.</p>
            <p>Along with the product owner, we established four main <strong>user personas</strong> encapsulating high
                to low
                level financial analysts, and of varied technical aptitude.</p>
            <p>When we joined the company, there were no existing <strong>analytics</strong> tools. We selected
                <strong>HotJar</strong> and <strong>Pendo</strong> so that we could view <strong>heatmaps, user behavior
                    recordings, contextual feedback, surveys, key metric recording (session time, stickiness, churn, and
                    NPS
                    scores), and track each behavior step through their experiences.</strong> We worked with development
                to make
                integration happen.

            <p>
                There was no existing process or tools in place for this portion of the design process. Bringing
                <strong>FigJam</strong> into the picture allowed us to map <strong>user flows per persona</strong>, that
                the
                product owner, stakeholders, business intelligence, and developers could collaborate on with us in real
                time.
                This
                gave us massive time savings as it eliminated a lot of previous back and forth before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leveraging <strong>FigJam</strong> to <strong>wire-frame component and screen states</strong> as well,
                yielded
                the
                same time saving thanks to real time collaboration. Completion and sign off of wire-frames before
                <strong>hi-fi
                    creation</strong> or actual developemnt also provided massive time savings.

        <article>
            <p>
                The existing <strong>design system</strong> was incomplete, there was only a basic document that detaled
                spacing,
                typography, coloration and basic styling for components. I <strong>designed a whole new design system
                    composed
                    of
                    an atomic design structure.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                There were no design files to work from upon my hire so drawing and <strong>re-skinning the entire
                    app</strong>
                in
                <strong>Figma</strong> was also an accomplishment during my time here. The app included over 200
                screens.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Prototyping</strong> the <strong>hi-fi mockups</strong> allowed me to provide user testing
                groups,
                developers, and stakeholders to test the actual design before any development occured, again saving
                resources
                and
                time.
