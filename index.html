          <h1>SpendHQ</h1>
          <p>SpendHQ is an all-in-one AI-powered spend intelligence dashboard web app for Fortune 500
            companies. It helps them see where their money is going by connecting all of their suppliers and relevant
            third-party software.</p>
          <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
          <ul class="accomplish">
            <li>NPS up 133%</li>
            <li>Product stickiness up 125%</li>
            <li>Average time spent on site up 50%</li>
            <li>Re-skin and Re-design of 100s of screens</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>SpendHQ had no professional designer before I joined the team, resulting in a dated, inconsistent, and
            clunky
            experience and interface. It was my job to lead and redesign the entire user experience and interface to
            modern design standards.</p>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Combining data from competitive research, user interviews, and testing, I analyzed user analytics collected
            through HotJar and Pendo (NPS, stickiness, time on site, retention, and heat mapping). We built personas for
            users from those needing simple reporting to CEOs who needed detailed data refining and filtering. Our user
            data and analytics informed my design for a new minimized, cohesive, and modern experience and interface,
            from scratch.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Discovered limited user feedback documented, no analytics or design artifacts existed</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Coordinated with the head of product, and head of development to setup and implement Pendo and
                Hotjar
                for
                user analytics</li>
              <li>Leveraged FigJam to map user flows, create personas, and collaborate on wire-frames before lo-fi or

                <ul>
                  <li>Enabled the product owner, stakeholders,
                    business intelligence, and developers to collaborate with us in real time. This gave us massive
                    time
                    savings</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Established four main user personas, encapsulating high to low-level financial analysts with varied
                technical aptitudes with the head of product</li>
              <li>Created a Figma ecosystem from scratch, including a new design system (utilizing atomic design),
                design file to mirror the 100s of screens in the current app, and a file for the from scratch
                re-design

                use amount
                <ul>
                  <li>10+ major and complex enhancements released in 2 years</li>
                  <li>Revealed several pain points in a major feature called the
                    power filter. This global control would filter all the data of every screen, thus allowing users to
                    condense the data into a lens digestible to them</li>
                  <li>After redesigning the power filter mostly as a global header compartmentalized element the could
                    be
                    finely tuned on the fly, vs a separate and complex screen, we saw massive improvements in generalized and specific user feedback and time to
                    completion of major goals</li>

              </li>
              <li>Created Hi-fi prototypes for user testing
                <ul>
                  <li>We could now test, and iterate on designs without developing actual coded prototypes, saving
                    hundreds of
                    hours of development time</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Tested product enhancements using the new analytics tools, leveraging user behavior recordings,

                NPS scores), and heat mapping

              <li>Designed re-skin in tandem of an app re-skin and enhancements

                  <li>Reducing cognitive overload, a major issue with the existing state of the app</li>

          <h1>NASCAR</h1>
          <p>NASCAR is the sanctioning body for stock-car racing in North America, responsible for
            making stock-car racing a widely popular sport in the United States by the turn of the 21st century.</p>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>NASCAR was restructuring from using third-party teams to repurposing internal teams to create the web and
            mobile app experiences for their properties. Non-PHP/WordPress developers were now building custom WordPress
            sites, and graphic designers were designing UX/UI experiences.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Bringing my Wordpress development and UX/UI design experience to the team helped me bridge the gap between
            the designers and developers, in building and releasing new websites, as well as enhancing the current ones.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Managing and creating website add-ons, display ads, and email campaigns was hectic, as there was no project
            management system, and the assets created frequently faced brand compliance, accessibility, and coding
            errors.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Researching the functions of every position in the agency, I designed and developed the “Phalanx” system to
            build (drag and drop), generate reports on, and track digital asset projects. Analysis of metrics collected
            in real-time user testing and internal analytics by the custom WordPress

              <li>Create a hypothesis, update the assets and template, and review the findings, keeping what worked and

                  <li>One of our biggest projects was the vehicle search modules included as the first and
                    dominant element on their homepages. By looking at the heat mapping and interaction metrics from
                    Google
                    Analytics,
                    <br /><br />We determined that there were two primary user groups with the same goal of locating a
                    vehicle but with different approaches. Some already had an idea of the exact make and model they
                    wanted, while others only had a vague idea.
                    <br /><br />
                    We implemented and A/B tested variants that allowed drop-down selection for year, make, and model,
                    one that had clickable images indicating make and model (sedan,
                    convertible, SUV, etc.), and a final variant that had both

              </li>
              <li>I noticed that we experienced a lot of coding, accessibility, and responsiveness errors, as well as
                long development times. Many of the webpages, ads, and email campaigns weren’t properly
                tested with Litmus, cross-browser tested, or designed based on performance analytics from Google or our
                email marketing performance metrics
                <ul>
                  <li>Some of these uncaught errors would have heavy consequences for our clients, as some dealers had a
                    three strike limit on OEM compliance violations, with a penalty of losing large amounts of OEM
                    funding</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>I designed and pitched a concept for a system I would come to design, build and manage called
                "Phalanx". This system would allow users to input the content and desired design for an email, website
                add-on, ad, landing pages and other deliverables for assets that were then generated in OEM compliant,
                error free, and responsive code instantly</li>
              <li>Designed and executed user tests for Phalanx directly with the SEO, email, ad, A/V, media buyer,
                account executive, and management teams

                    through how they used the system daily and show me any pain points in their user paths
                  </li>
                  <li>Designed a few tasks for them to complete so that I could see if my designed user paths aligned
                    with their actual goals</li>
                </ul>

              <li>Developed Phalanx as a custom WordPress theme with custom plugins
                <ul>
                  <li>Custom component UI library developed with HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and PHP that Phalanx would
                    generate visual assets for the websites, emails, and display ads</li>
                  <li>If an asset was highly custom, we
                    would create it from scratch, but Phalanx performed at least 90% of the assets</li>

              <li>Deliverables were optimized by data from Google
                Analytics, heat mapping, Visual Web Optimizer, and Campaigner for performance, and built upon frameworks
                that work across all browsers and email clients</li>
              <li>Designed and developed a job management, staff performance reporting, budget reporting, and client
                relationship management system into Phalanx to accommodate other gaps missing in our overall process</li>

          <h1>Wick</h1>
          <p>Wick is a mobile app that makes the journey of improving ones well-being a comforting and
            enjoyable adventure.</p>
          <h3>Major Accomplishment</h3>
          <ul class="accomplish">
            <li>100% User Approval Rating of the New Well-being Science Education & Tracking Experience</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Learning and applying the science of well-being is a time-consuming, difficult, and confusing endeavor. It
            requires learning a large amount of sometimes complicated subject matter and tracking several goals on one’s
            journey to improved well-being.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>We created a gamified, step-by-step well-being improvement journey and education mobile app. This app
            breaks down the science into bite-sized, easy-to-understand language and gives weighted rewards for each
            step taken to learn and apply the science to daily life.</p>

                  <li>Features
                    <ul>
                      <li>Noticed a lack of robust gamification, which excited us about filling that niche
                      <li>Encouraged repeat app usage by awarding points for completing tasks
                        (with
                        weighted rewards based on the difficulty of the task) and earning badges. This melded well with
                        the
                        friendly
                        writing tone and positive encouragement throughout the app</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>We found that most apps employed a similar visual language, primarily using a clean, minimal
                    aesthetic</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                    into
                    the experience and the app learning process, white-boarding was the best approach, as it

                    the initial design process</li>

              <li>Branding and design system
                <ul>
                  <li>We imagined our app as the torch that
                    accompanied
                    users on their path to self-improvement
                    <ul>
                      <li>Incorporated a fire
                        motif
                        into our logo, with the flame resting in the crossed arms of the W, like a fire brazier</li>
                      <li>
                        Wick was a short and catchy name that immediately brought comforting fire to mind</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Chose a font with an earthy, grounded, and rugged feel</li>
                  <li>The sans-serif font was modern enough for a
                    self-help app, and resembled fonts used in state park assets and signs, such as on hiking trails
                  </li>
                  <li>Feelings of adventure and immersion in nature became our target experience
                    <ul>
                      <li>Selected cool greens and blues in contrast to the yellow and orange CTAs to communicate this
                      </li>
                      <li>Illustrated visuals throughout the entire app and
                        iconography related to camping and adventure</li>
