        <p><strong>Role</strong>: Lead UX/UI Designer and Mid-level UX Researcher</p>
        <p><strong>Tools</strong>: Figjam, Figma, Hotjar, Jira, Notion, Pendo, User Interviews, and User Testing</p>

        <p class="spacer-top">SpendHQ is an all-in-one AI-powered spend intelligence dashboard web app for Fortune 500
          companies. It helps them see where their money is going by connecting all of their suppliers and relevant
          third-party software.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>SpendHQ had no professional designer before I joined the team, resulting in a dated, inconsistent, and clunky
          experience and interface. It was my job to lead and redesign the entire user experience and interface to
          modern design standards.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Combining data from competitive research, user interviews, and testing with clients including Pepsi and Under
          Armour, I analyzed user analytics collected through HotJar and Pendo (NPS, stickiness, time on site,
          retention, and heat mapping). I built personas including users who need simple reporting to CEOs who need
          detailed data refining and filtering. I informed a new minimized, cohesive, and modern experience and
          interface from scratch.</p>
        <p>The product owner and I reviewed the analytics every few weeks to verify the new experiences and design
          enhancements were performing as we released them iteratively. This allowed us to refine each update and slowly
          bring the users up to date, rather than shocking them with a new experience and interface all at once.</p>
        <div class="collapse">
          <a href="#" class="btn accordion">Research</a>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>When I joined the team, the product owner, (who started around the same time as I did), and I sat with
              major clients, including Pepsi and Under Armour, to understand their current likes and dislikes with the
              existing product.</p>
            <p>One of these user interview sessions revealed several pain points in a major feature called the power
              filter. After redesigning this feature, we saw massive improvements in user feedback and time to
              completion
              of major goals.</p>
            <p>Along with the product owner, we established four main user personas, encapsulating high- to low-level
              financial analysts with varied technical aptitudes.</p>
            <p>When we joined, there were no existing analytics tools. We selected HotJar and Pendo to view heatmaps,
              user
              behavior recordings, contextual feedback, surveys, key metric recordings (session time, stickiness, churn,
              and NPS scores), and to track each behavior step through their experiences. We worked with development to
              make integration happen.</p>

          <div class="panel">
            <p>There were no existing processes or tools in place for this portion of the design process. Bringing
              FigJam
              into the picture allowed us to map user flows per persona, enabling the product owner, stakeholders,
              business intelligence, and developers to collaborate with us in real time. This gave us massive time
              savings
              as it eliminated a lot of previous back and forth.</p>
            <p>Leveraging FigJam to wireframe component and screen states, also yielded the same time savings thanks to
              real-time collaboration. Completion and sign-off of wireframes, before hi-fi creation or actual
              development,
              also provided massive time savings.</p>

          <a href="#" class="btn accordion">UI Design</a>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The existing design system was incomplete; there was only a basic document that detailed spacing,
              typography, coloration, and basic styling for components. I designed a whole new design system composed of
              an atomic design structure.</p>
            <p>There were no design files to work from when I was hired, so drawing and re-skinning the entire app in
              Figma was also an accomplishment during my time here. The app included over 200 screens.</p>
            <p>Prototyping the hi-fi mockups allowed me to provide user testing groups, developers, and stakeholders
              with
              the opportunity to test the actual design before any development occurred, thereby saving resources and
              time.</p>

        <p class="spacer-top">NASCAR is the sanctioning body for stock-car racing in North America, responsible for
          making stock-car racing a widely popular sport in the United States by the turn of the 21st century.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>NASCAR was restructuring from using third-party teams to repurposing internal teams to create the web and
          mobile app experiences for their properties. Non-PHP/WordPress developers were now building custom WordPress
          sites, and graphic designers were designing UX/UI experiences.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>My WordPress development skills, combined with my UX/UI design experience, made me an excellent fit to bridge
          the gap between the graphic designers refining their designs for the web and the developers using best
          WordPress practices. I launched the websites for ARCA, NASCAR Mexico, and Sebring Raceway, and updated the
          official sites for NASCAR and IMSA.</p>
        <p>During some weekend races, one live ops member and I would sit alone in the monitoring room in NASCAR
          headquarters in Charlotte, NC. If anything went wrong with any of our web experiences or features, such as the
          real-time lap time reporting, it was up to me to fix it.</p>

          <a href="#" class="btn accordion">Research</a>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>My work started with creative briefings from the product manager and assigned designer. These briefings
              informed me of the research findings, so that any design modifications were as informed as possible.</p>
            <p>I would submit design modification recommendations for review by the product manager, client, designer,
              and
              other stakeholders. Once all parties had signed off, development began.</p>

            <p>The designers I worked with were repurposed graphic designers, so guidance for working with the web was
              essential for ensuring accessibility, usability, and industry-standard practices were applied, ensuring
              the
              quality of the experience and interface.</p>
            <p>We'd go through revisions until the designer and I felt the designs were complete, for product manager
              and
              client/stakeholder sign-off.</p>

            <p>I utilized, modified, and added to their existing custom WordPress theme and plugins. The websites I
              created were exclusively assigned to me. I'd work within their Atlassian system (Jira) to update the
              project
              as it was completed. Tickets were separated by page or major feature.</p>
            <p>I worked in sync with the product owner and designer to execute the client's requirements while adhering
              to
              proper practices to ensure the quality of the product. If any issues were found during QA, it would be
              reassigned to me for bug fixes or requested modifications.</p>
            <p>During major races and events, which usually occurred on weekends, only one live ops team member and I
              would occupy the 8th floor of the NASCAR building in downtown Charlotte. We'd be on standby while
              monitoring
              the race so I could correct any issues with the website, especially the live race tracking metrics.</p>

          for their car dealership clients, including all major car brands from Aston Martin to Volvo.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Managing and creating website add-ons, display ads, and email campaigns was hectic, as there was no project
          management system, and the assets created frequently faced brand compliance, accessibility, and coding errors.
        </p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Researching the functions of every position in the agency, I designed and developed the “Phalanx” system to
          build (drag and drop), generate reports on, and track digital asset projects.</p>
        <p>Analysis of metrics collected in real-time user testing and internal analytics by the custom WordPress
          platform allowed measurement of goal completion, time, and quality.</p>
        <div class="collapse">
          <a href="#" class="btn accordion">Research</a>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>I would start web, email, and ad design projects by analyzing the requests sent to us by the account
              executives, responding directly to them or with OEM compliance for any questions or additional
              information about the target audience or goals of their campaigns.</p>
            <p>After completion, we would look at
              Google Analytics, Visual Web Optimizer, heat mapping, and Campaigner (email) analytics to see what was
              and was not working. We would create a hypothesis, update the assets and template, and review the
              findings, keeping what worked and eliminating what did not.</p>
            <p>For example, one of our biggest projects was the vehicle search modules included as the first and
              dominant element on their homepages. By looking at the heat mapping and interaction metrics from Google
              Analytics, we determined that there were two primary user groups with the same goal of locating a
              vehicle but with different approaches.</p>
            <p>Some already had an idea of the exact make and model they wanted,
              while others only had a vague idea. We implemented and A/B tested variants that allowed drop-down
              selection for year, make, and model, one that had clickable images indicating make and model (sedan,
              convertible, SUV, etc.), and a final variant that had both.</p>
            <p>I designed and executed user tests for Phalanx directly with all departments. I’d have them walk me
              through how they used the system daily and show me any pain points in their user paths. This gave me
              insights into their natural, unguided usage. I also designed a few tasks for them to complete so that I
              could see if my designed user paths aligned with their actual goals.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="collapse">
          <a href="#" class="btn accordion">Design</a>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>After collecting the goals and requirements from our clients or account executives, we would either
              create a new site, page, ad, or email campaign from scratch if the request was highly custom, or utilize
              a high-performing template as a boilerplate. High-fidelity mock-ups were created, passed through OEM
              compliance and the client for approval, and then built in Phalanx. If an asset was highly custom, we
              would create it from scratch, but Phalanx performed at least 90% of the assets.</p>
            <p>I noticed this caused many problems as many of the webpages, ads, and email campaigns weren’t properly
              tested with Litmus, cross-browser tested, or designed based on performance analytics from Google or our
              email marketing performance metrics. These oversights cost our clients performance loss, as assets would
              either break or not be optimized.</p>
            <p>As a solution, I designed and pitched Phalanx, a custom WordPress site that generated these assets. These
              website assets, emails, ads, and landing pages were designed and optimized by data from Google
              Analytics, heat mapping, Visual Web Optimizer, and Campaigner for performance, and built upon frameworks
              that work across all browsers and email clients.</p>

            <p>Phalanx also functioned as a job management, staff performance reporting, budget reporting, and client
              relationship management system. I developed it as a custom WordPress theme with custom plugins. I worked
              with the SEO, email, ad, A/V, media buyer, account executive, and management teams to collect and
              analyze performance. I developed a custom component UI library with HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and PHP
              that Phalanx would generate visual assets for the websites, emails, and display ads.</p>

        <p class="spacer-top">Wick is a mobile app that makes the journey of improving one’s well-being a comforting and
          enjoyable adventure.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Learning and applying the science of well-being is a time-consuming, difficult, and confusing endeavor. It
          requires learning a large amount of sometimes complicated subject matter and tracking several goals on one’s
          journey to improved well-being.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>We created a gamified, step-by-step well-being improvement journey and education mobile app. This app breaks
          down the science into bite-sized, easy-to-understand language and gives weighted rewards for each step taken
          to learn and apply the science to daily life.</p>
        <p>Research included a SWOT analysis of the top 25 competing apps in the health and wellness space (existing
          user experiences, features, flows, visual language, and UI patterns), persona creation (adults 19-40 at all
          different stages of a well-being journey), and phone interviews collecting quantitative and qualitative data
          (current well-being apps used, duration, device used, likes and dislikes of their experiences), their current
          well-being improvement behaviors and their duration and importance to them, and their overall interest in
          Wick’s mission.</p>
        <p>We designed the experience and interface from the ground up with this data, starting with card sorting, then
          whiteboarding, brand and design system development, lo-fi prototypes, and a hi-fi prototype, adjusted based on
          feedback from testing our lo-fi prototype.</p>
        <p>We verified acceptance and satisfaction via feedback during user testing of our lo-fi prototype, then
          performed a second user test with a hi-fi prototype evolved upon findings of the lo-fi test. We utilized our
          research group to compare results to an established user base.</p>
        <p>All users agreed that they enjoyed the journey format of the app and that they preferred our experience over
          the other apps they were currently using on their well-being journey.</p>

          <div class="panel">

            <p>We conducted competitive research on the top 25 competing apps in the Health and Wellness space,
              including
              a
              SWOT analysis that examined their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. We analyzed their
              user
              experiences, features, flows, visual language, and UI patterns.</p>

            <p>We found that most apps employed a similar visual language, primarily using a clean, minimal aesthetic.
              We
              also
              noticed a lack of robust gamification, which excited us about filling that niche.</p>

            <p>We created personas based on our ideal user profiles. After narrowing them down to three different
              persona
              types, including our core target group of adults aged 19-40 years old and at various stages of their
              well-being
              journeys, we reached out to them for phone interviews.</p>

            <p>We collected quantitative and qualitative data ranging from device type, hourly usage, and the number of
              existing or previously used health apps, to self-help/health behaviors they engage in and for how long,
              and
              gauged interest in our app.</p>

            <p>We asked if they would consider using an application like ours, what they thought their most important
              positive
              habits were, and more. We found they had an overall lack of interest in repetitive and “boring”
              interactions
              with the applications they were using.</p>

          <div class="panel">

            <p>There were many ideas for names, but we settled on Wick. We imagined our app as the torch that
              accompanied
              users on their path to self-improvement. Wick was a short and catchy name that immediately brought the
              image
              of
              fire to mind. We chose a font with an earthy, grounded, rugged feel.</p>

            <p>In developing our brand, we kept returning to the words “Journey” and “Adventure.” Most of us had played
              the
              game “Firewatch” and were inspired by its warm and exciting feelings of adventure and immersion in nature.
              We
              selected cool greens and blues in contrast to the yellow and orange CTAs to communicate this.</p>

            <p>Our language was down-to-earth, comforting, and empathetic. The sans-serif font was modern enough for a
              self-help app but still resembled fonts used in state parks and on hiking trails. We incorporated a fire
              motif
              into our logo, with the flame resting in the crossed arms of the W, like a fire brazier.</p>

            <p>After creating personas from the data collected in our user interviews, we would whiteboard flows and
              wireframes that attempted to accommodate all of the personas at once. As gamification introduces
              complexity
              into
              the experience and the app learning process, this seemed like the best approach, as it flattened and
              streamlined
              the experience.</p>
            <p>We also created a detailed wireframe in Figma that incorporated our approved whiteboard designs. This
              allowed
              us to iterate and ideate quickly, and only spend larger amounts of time and energy on fleshed-out ideas.
            </p>
            <p>Prototyping this new complete lo-fi allowed us to test the app remotely with our original user interview
              group.
              This provided many valuable insights as having them step through the app and speak their thoughts aloud
              revealed
              pain points that we stamped out before the hi-fi prototype, and also revealed new insights or ideas, some
              of
              which were incorporated into the final design.</p>

            <p>Part of our visual language included beautifully illustrated visuals throughout the entire app and
              iconography
              related to camping and adventure. We encouraged repeat app usage by awarding points for completing tasks
              (with
              weighted rewards based on the difficulty of the task) and earning badges. This melded well with the
              friendly
              writing tone and positive encouragement throughout the app.</p>

            <p>Next, we mocked up the high-resolution designs for each screen in the user flow. We fleshed out every
              possible
              user state identified in our lo-fi prototype and brought it to life using our established visual language.
              Using
              Adobe XD, we created an interactive hi-fi prototype for final testing before development.</p>
