        <h2>400% Increase in Task Efficiency. 90% Reduction in Accessibility, Compliance &amp; Coding Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>Role</strong>: Lead UX/UI Designer, Lead UI Developer, and Junior UX Researcher.</p>

        <p>Automotive Management Services Inc. (AMSI) manages and executes all digital advertising for their car dealership clients, including all major car brands from Aston Martin to Volvo.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Managing and creating website add-ons, display ads, and email campaigns was hectic, as there was no project management system, and the assets created frequently faced brand compliance, accessibility, and coding errors.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Researching the functions of every position in the agency, I designed and developed the “Phalanx” system to build (drag and drop), generate reports on, and track digital asset projects.</p>
        <p>Analysis of metrics collected in real-time user testing and internal analytics by the custom WordPress platform allowed measurement of goal completion, time, and quality.</p>

        <h2>New Sites Launched for NASCAR Mexico, ARCA, and Sebring Raceway</h2>
        <p><strong>Role</strong>: Senior UI Developer and UX/UI Design Consultant.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools</strong>: CSS, Figma, Git, Gulp, HTML, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, SASS, Twig, and Wordpress</p>

        <p>NASCAR is the sanctioning body for stock-car racing in North America, responsible for making stock-car racing a widely popular sport in the United States by the turn of the 21st century.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>NASCAR was restructuring from using third-party teams to repurposing internal teams to create the web and mobile app experiences for their properties. Non-PHP/WordPress developers were now building custom WordPress sites, and graphic designers were designing UX/UI experiences.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>My WordPress development skills, combined with my UX/UI design experience, made me an excellent fit to bridge the gap between the graphic designers refining their designs for the web and the developers using best WordPress practices. I launched the websites for ARCA, NASCAR Mexico, and Sebring Raceway, and updated the official sites for NASCAR and IMSA.</p>
        <p>During some weekend races, one live ops member and I would sit alone in the monitoring room in NASCAR headquarters in Charlotte, NC. If anything went wrong with any of our web experiences or features, such as the real-time lap time reporting, it was up to me to fix it.</p>

        <h2>NPS up 133%, product stickiness up 125%, and average time spent on site up 50%</h2>
        <p><strong>Role</strong>: ead UX/UI Designer and Mid-level UX Researcher</p>
        <p><strong>Tools</strong>: Figjam, Figma, Hotjar, Jira, Notion, Pendo, User Interviews, and User Testing</p>

        <p>SpendHQ is an all-in-one AI-powered spend intelligence dashboard web app for Fortune 500 companies. It helps them see where their money is going by connecting all of their suppliers and relevant third-party software.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>SpendHQ had no professional designer before I joined the team, resulting in a dated, inconsistent, and clunky experience and interface. It was my job to lead and redesign the entire user experience and interface to modern design standards.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Combining data from competitive research, user interviews, and testing with clients including Pepsi and Under Armour, I analyzed user analytics collected through HotJar and Pendo (NPS, stickiness, time on site, retention, and heat mapping). I built personas including users who need simple reporting to CEOs who need detailed data refining and filtering. I informed a new minimized, cohesive, and modern experience and interface from scratch.</p>
        <p>The product owner and I reviewed the analytics every few weeks to verify the new experiences and design enhancements were performing as we released them iteratively. This allowed us to refine each update and slowly bring the users up to date, rather than shocking them with a new experience and interface all at once.</p>

        <p>Wick is a mobile app that makes the journey of improving one’s well-being a comforting and enjoyable adventure.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Learning and applying the science of well-being is a time-consuming, difficult, and confusing endeavor. It requires learning a large amount of sometimes complicated subject matter and tracking several goals on one’s journey to improved well-being.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>We created a gamified, step-by-step well-being improvement journey and education mobile app. This app breaks down the science into bite-sized, easy-to-understand language and gives weighted rewards for each step taken to learn and apply the science to daily life.</p>
        <p>Research included a SWOT analysis of the top 25 competing apps in the health and wellness space (existing user experiences, features, flows, visual language, and UI patterns), persona creation (adults 19-40 at all different stages of a well-being journey), and phone interviews collecting quantitative and qualitative data (current well-being apps used, duration, device used, likes and dislikes of their experiences), their current well-being improvement behaviors and their duration and importance to them, and their overall interest in Wick’s mission.</p>
        <p>We designed the experience and interface from the ground up with this data, starting with card sorting, then whiteboarding, brand and design system development, lo-fi prototypes, and a hi-fi prototype, adjusted based on feedback from testing our lo-fi prototype.</p>
        <p>We verified acceptance and satisfaction via feedback during user testing of our lo-fi prototype, then performed a second user test with a hi-fi prototype evolved upon findings of the lo-fi test. We utilized our research group to compare results to an established user base.</p>
        <p>All users agreed that they enjoyed the journey format of the app and that they preferred our experience over the other apps they were currently using on their well-being journey.</p>
