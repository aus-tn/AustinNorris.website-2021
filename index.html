          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            I worked on NASCAR.com, ARCA, Sebring, and NASCAR Mexico. Each site utilized a master WordPress theme and plugins which allowed us to provide the clients with powerful
            features such as easy to configure galleries, video and schedule pages, options for colors, fonts,
            spacing and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Utilizing the approved mock-ups (InVision) from design, I wrote custom CSS, HTML, javascript, PHP, and Twig on top of the existing framework to provide the client with a tailored experience. I worked within an Agile (Atlassian) system with a designer and project manager for each project.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            I worked on a team of four other UX/UI Researchers and Designers including <a href="https://www.andrewsantoro.com" target="_blank">Andrew Santoro</a>, <a href="http://jwwdsgn.com" target="_blank">Justin Webb</a>, Nikki Sereno, and Leah Herman.
            User interviews were conducted with 10 participants, we collected
            quantitative and qualitative data ranging from device type, hourly
            usage, number of existing or previously used health apps, to which
            self help/health behaviors they engage in and for how long, and
            gauged interest in such an app. Using the interview data we created
            user personas. User testing was also performed with a low fi
            prototype, we provided users with a few flows to complete from
            onboarding, and adding a task, to navigating the gamification
            features. Competitor research included a SWOT analysis of the top 25
            competing apps, analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities
            and threats from their user experience, features, flows and UI.
          </p>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            Starting with the mood board, we looked to provide feelings of
            comfort, wonder, adventure, and relaxation. Cool greens and blues
            were selected in contrast to the yellow and orange CTAs to
            communicate this. Language was down to earth, comforting and
            empathetic. Use of soft graphics and iconography was used to give it
            a fun, and non-intimidating experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brand standards were created, detailing everything from font usage,
            sizing, spacing, element spacing, sizing, logo usage, imagery style,
            coloring and more to ensure a consistent experience across the site.
            User flows, and process flows were created in lo-fi, tested in a
            lo-fi prototype, then a high-fi mockups and flows were created based
            on the findings. A high-fi prototype was created and user tested as
            well.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            I would start web, email and ad design projects by analyzing the
            request sent to us by the account executives, and respond directly
            to them or with OEM compliance with any questions or additional
            information about the target audience, or goals of their campaigns.
            After completion we would look at Google Analytics, Visual Web
            Optimizer, heat mapping and Campaigner (email) analytics to see what
            was and was not working, we would create a hypothesis, update the
            assets and template, and review the findings, keeping what worked,
            and eliminating what did not.
          </p>
          <p>
            In example, one of our biggest such projects was the vehicle search
            modules included as the first, and dominant element on their
            homepages. Looking at the heat mapping and interaction metrics from
            Google Analytics we were able to determine that there were two
            primary user groups with the same goal of locating a vehicle but
            with different approaches. Some already had an idea of the exact
            make and model that they wanted, while others only had a vague idea.
            We implemented and A/B tested variants that allowed drop down
            selection for year, make, and model, another that had clickable
            images that indicated make and model (sedan, convertible, SUV,
            etc,), and a final variant that had both.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed and executed user tests for Phalanx directly with all
            departments. I’d have them walk me through how they used the system
            on a daily basis, show me any pain points on their paths. This gave
            me insights into their natural unguided usage. I also designed a few
            tasks for them to complete so that I could see if my designed user
            paths were in line with their actual goals.
          </p>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            After collecting the goals and requirements from our clients or
            account executives, we would either create a new site, page, ad, or
            email campaign from scratch if the request was highly custom, or
            utilize a highly performing template as a boilerplate. High fidelity
            mock-ups and designs were created, passed through OEM compliance and
            the client for approval, and then built in Phalanx. If an asset was
            highly custom we would create this from scratch, but Phalanx
            performed at least 90% of the assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            I noticed this caused a lot of problems as many of the webpages, ads
            and email campaigns weren’t properly litmus, cross browser tested,
            or designed based on performance analytics from Google or our email
            marketing performance metrics. These oversights cost our clients
            performance loss, as assets would either break or not be optimized.
            As a solution I designed and pitched Phalanx, a custom WordPress
            site that generated these assets. These website assets, emails, ads,
            and landing pages that were designed and optimized by data from
            Google Analytics, heat mapping, Visual Web Optimizer, and Campaigner
            for performance, and upon frameworks that work across all browsers
            and email clients.
          </p>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            Phalanx also functioned as a job management, staff performance
            reporting, budget reporting, and client relationship management
            system. I build it as a custom theme with custom plugins. I worked with the SEO, email, ad, AV, media buyer, account executive and management teams to collect and analyze performance. I built a custom component UI library that Phalanx would generate for the endpoint websites, emails, display ads and more.

            <p>
                Google Analytics was invaluable in helping determine the most popular vehicles, makes, models, years and parts for each. This helped me build the information architecture for the products, including which meta is most important, their categorization, their hierarchy and their individual promotion positions on the pages. A/B testing the new site against the previous one in Google Analytics was one of my main points of data that drove the optimization of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working directly under the CEO, and on a site where customers would bring in their cars for upgrades, and where we housed the custom built Steeda cars, I was able to directly interact with the end users, getting a feel for their personality types, making user profiles an easy task. It also made creating user flows and paths much easier. I also installed feedback plugins and collected feedback from the sales team.

                <p>The information hierarchy was built upon the most popular parts reported by Google Analytics. The navigation and sub navigation then mirrored the categorization of parts (starting at model, then to year, category, then sub-category), The users were almost always car enthusiasts who knew exactly what they wanted so the mission was to help direct them to what they were looking for. This navigation style catered to this, and the search bar included on the sticky header picked up any slack, and provided shortcuts to get the users to their parts faster.</p>
                
                <p>The most popular parts were always hoisted to the top of pages, descriptions, links to and CTAs were designed to be as apparent as possible to help steer the repeat customers, and customers who came to learn about the best offerings from Steeda. Imagery from their events was included in a lot of the hero portions of pages to promote our most loyal community members, and raise awareness of such events.</p>
                
                <p>Leveraging feedback and data from the new analytics and feedback tools, I was able to reduce and streamline the checkout process. We integrated a one page checkout, and added new promotional code sections which we also included to specific user groups via targeted advertising. We saw increases in user satisfaction, goal completion, and uptime across the board.  </p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                After rebuilding the CS Cart sites for Mustang, Fiesta, Focus, and Fusion sites. I then pitched a new platform 3D Cart. 3D Cart was far more modernized, stable, mature, and offered better architecture, support and front-end customization. Their headquarters was also less than 10 miles from our location, they brought us on site during onboarding and provided priority support. Integrations for the ERP and payment processing systems were new pieces we were able to get in the works with this new platform.

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            First I collected all the product data, so I could organize and
            prioritize the products, their meta and categories. I organized the
            IA with this data as well as the marketing content and imagery
            available. I then mapped it to a site map and wire-frame of each of
            the pages, for approval of the VP. After approval I created high
            fidelity mock-up with presentation to explain why things were placed
            where they were and why they were styled a certain way in terms of
            ROI.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soft earthy expressive and elegant typography and colors with
            gratiutious white space were chosen were used as much as possible
            without sacrificing functionality, UX, and scanning/flow. This
            helped provided a clean, open, airy, bright feel through out the
            site.
          </p>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            After approval of the high-fidelity mock-ups, I researched popular
            keywords and injected them into the site, as well as setup of Google
            Webmaster, and other search engine registrations. Plugins were
            installed to check and optimize SEO as we built. I designed and
            built the new site upon Shopify using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery,
            Bootstrap, and Liquid. I also designed and built the email campaigns
            using the Mailchimp framework. I also designed banners, display ads,
            and social media graphics in Photoshop, and Illustrator.

          <h3>Data Driven Design</h3>
          <p>
            Competitive SWOT Analysis is always vital, from keywords to feel,
            typography, tone, usability, feature inventory, and heuristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data Analysis of available analytics is a tool I always look to
            utilize. Micro & macro event and conversion tracking is paramount.
            In page analytics such as heat maps, and user interaction metrics
            such as time on page, bounce, entrance etc. enable decision making
            that's almost guaranteed to increase ROI.
          </p>
          <p>
            User research is a core component I integrate. From interviews, to
            surveys, to moderated testing, building personas, flows, use cases,
            and red paths allows informed design rather than guessing based on
            best practices alone. I don't forget the stakeholders, I interview
            them as well to be sure my designs are goal aligned.

          <h3>It's for the users</h3>
          <p>
            After the research phase, I'm able to begin creating data and user feedback informed designs. Mood boards are usually where to start if brand standards are not already in place. Auditing, minimizing, and organizing content by priority is where I look next, this allows me to develop flow charts and site maps that can have the content mapped on it appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sketching and brainstorming always comes next. Once this has occurred I move to wire-framing. I look for proven design patterns from the industry, and modify those that fit the use case, and that have been proven to ensure maximized functionality and experience. After wire-frames are approved, I move to high fidelity mock-ups. I usually use Adobe XD, but I've also worked with Figma, and InVision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Documenting the design into a design system is priority at this point. This way typography, spacing, colors, imagery, tone, and more is always consistent, per the created style guide. I develop pattern libraries as well in the form of coded components and templates. Accessibility is tested, using WAZE and other prototyping plugins so no one is left out.

          <h3>Keeping it simple</h3>
          <p>
           I've developed themes and plugins on many platforms. Craft CMS, Ghost CMS, Shopify, Wordpress, and Webflow primarily. I often select hosting solutions, and the CMS to be used in the project. This requires some server, back-end, CMS, database, domain  setup and management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Documentation, commented and minimized code is very important to me, no one wants compounding technical debt. When possible I opt for the vanilla solution, and only add libraries, packages, or frameworks when their advantages outweigh their drawbacks. I always opt in for browser and device testing, I've used BrowserStack, and Litmus testing to ensure functionality.
