          <h1>SpendHQ</h1>
          <p>SpendHQ is an all-in-one AI-powered spend intelligence dashboard web app for Fortune 500
            companies. It helps them see where their money is going by connecting all of their suppliers and relevant
            third-party software.</p>
          <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
          <ul class="accomplish">
            <li>NPS up 133%</li>
            <li>Product stickiness up 125%</li>
            <li>Average time spent on site up 50%</li>
            <li>Re-skin and Re-design of 100s of screens</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>SpendHQ had no professional designer before I joined the team, resulting in a dated, inconsistent, and
            clunky
            experience and interface. It was my job to lead and redesign the entire user experience and interface to
            modern design standards.</p>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Combining data from competitive research, user interviews, and testing, I analyzed user analytics collected through HotJar and Pendo (NPS, stickiness, time on site, retention, and heat mapping). I built personas including users who need simple reporting to CEOs who need detailed data refining and filtering. Our data informed a new minimized, cohesive, and modern experience and interface from scratch.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Discovered limited user feedback documented, no analytics or design artifacts existed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Cordinated with the head of product, and head of development to setup and impletment Pendo and
                Hotjar
                for
                user analytics</li>
              <li>Leveraged FigJam to map user flows, create personas, and collaborate on wireframes before hi-fi
                designs
                <ul>
                  <li>Enabled the product owner, stakeholders,
                    business intelligence, and developers to collaborate with us in real time. This gave us massive
                    time
                    savings</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Established four main user personas, encapsulating high to low-level financial analysts with varied
                technical aptitudes with the head of product</li>
              <li>Created a Figma ecosystem from scratch, including a new design system (utilizing atomic design), a
                design file to mirror the 100s of screens in the current app, and a file for the from scratch
                re-design
                and it's design system.

              <li>Conceptualize and design product enhancements based on priority of user need and use
                <ul>
                  <li>Product received many immediate enhancements to function and design</li>
                  <li>Re-design being created in tandem for readiness when it became priority</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Designed and executed user testing with major clients including Pepsi and UnderArmour
                <ul>
                  <li>One of these user interview sessions revealed several pain points in a major feature called the
                    power filter. This global control would filter all the data of every screen, thus allowing users to
                    condense the data into a lens digestable to them.</li>
                  <li>After redesigning the power filter mostly as a global header compartmentalized element the could
                    be
                    finely tuned on the fly, vs a separate and complex screen, we saw massive improvements in
                    gneraliszed and specific user feedback and
                    time
                    to

              <li>Created Hi-fi prototypes for user testing
                <ul>
                  <li>We could now test, and iterate on designs without developing actual coded prototypes, saving
                    hundreds of
                    hours of development time</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Tested product enhancements using the new analytics tools, leveraging user behavior recordings,
                contextual feedback, surveys, key metric recordings (session time, stickiness, churn/retention, and
                NPS
                scores), and heat mapping

                  <li>User confusion as to what they were looking at on any given screen was a major problem in the app.

          <h1>NASCAR</h1>
          <p>NASCAR is the sanctioning body for stock-car racing in North America, responsible for
            making stock-car racing a widely popular sport in the United States by the turn of the 21st century.</p>

          </ul>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>NASCAR was restructuring from using third-party teams to repurposing internal teams to create the web and
            mobile app experiences for their properties. Non-PHP/WordPress developers were now building custom WordPress
            sites, and graphic designers were designing UX/UI experiences.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Bringing my wordpress deveopment and UX/UI design experience to the team helped me bridge the gap for them,
            between the designers and developers in building and releasing new websites.</p>

                    Analytics, we determined that there were two primary user groups with the same goal of locating a
                    vehicle but with different approaches. Some already had an idea of the exact make and model they
                    wanted,
                    while others only had a vague idea. We implemented and A/B tested variants that allowed drop-down

                    convertible, SUV, etc.), and a final variant that had both</li>

                    website assets, emails, ads, and landing pages were designed and optimized by data from Google
                    Analytics, heat mapping, Visual Web Optimizer, and Campaigner for performance, and built upon frameworks
                    that work across all browsers and email clients.</li>
                  <li>If an asset was highly custom, we
                    would create it from scratch, but Phalanx performed at least 90% of the assets</li>
                  <li>Developed it as a custom WordPress theme with custom plugins. I worked
                    with the SEO, email, ad, A/V, media buyer, account executive, and management teams to collect and
                    analyze performance. I developed a custom component UI library with HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and
                    PHP
                    that Phalanx would generate visual assets for the websites, emails, and display ads</li>

              </li>
              <li>I designed and developed a job management, staff performance reporting, budget reporting, and client
                relationship management system into Phalanx to accomodate other gaps missing in our overall process</li>

          <h1>Wick</h1>
          <p>Wick is a mobile app that makes the journey of improving ones well-being a comforting and
            enjoyable adventure.</p>
          <h3>Major Accomplishment</h3>
          <ul class="accomplish">
            <li>100% User Approval Rating of the New Well-being Science Education & Tracking Experience</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Learning and applying the science of well-being is a time-consuming, difficult, and confusing endeavor. It
            requires learning a large amount of sometimes complicated subject matter and tracking several goals on one’s
            journey to improved well-being.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>We created a gamified, step-by-step well-being improvement journey and education mobile app. This app
            breaks down the science into bite-sized, easy-to-understand language and gives weighted rewards for each
            step taken to learn and apply the science to daily life.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Noticed a lack of robust gamification, which excited us about filling that niche
                      <li>Encouraged repeat app usage by awarding points for completing tasks
                        (with
                        weighted rewards based on the difficulty of the task) and earning badges. This melded well with
                        the
                        friendly
                        writing tone and positive encouragement throughout the app</li>

                  <li>We found that most apps employed a similar visual language, primarily using a clean, minimal
                    aesthetic</li>

                        Wick was a short and catchy name that immediately brought the

                  <li>The sans-serif font was modern enough for a
