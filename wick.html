      <p>At OddOwls LLC, our focus was on making it easy and fun to achieve your well-being goals, which led us to gamification. This approach encapsulated not only our desire to create something genuinely helpful but also highlighted our focus on a shared journey.</p>
      <p>We landed on the tagline “An adventure to a better you,” and our mission statement became “To make the journey of self-improvement fun, simple, and accessible.”</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>

      <p>We conducted competitive research on the top 25 competing apps in the Health and Wellness space, including a SWOT analysis that examined their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. We analyzed their user experiences, features, flows, visual language, and UI patterns.</p>

      <p>We found that most apps employed a similar visual language, primarily using a clean, minimal aesthetic. We also noticed a lack of robust gamification, which excited us about filling that niche.</p>

      <p>We created personas based on our ideal user profiles. After narrowing them down to three different persona types, including our core target group of adults aged 19-40 years old and at various stages of their well-being journeys, we reached out to them for phone interviews.</p>

      <p>We collected quantitative and qualitative data ranging from device type, hourly usage, and the number of existing or previously used health apps, to self-help/health behaviors they engage in and for how long, and gauged interest in our app.</p>

      <p>We asked if they would consider using an application like ours, what they thought their most important positive habits were, and more. We found they had an overall lack of interest in repetitive and “boring” interactions with the applications they were using.</p>

      <h2>Branding</h2>

      <p>There were many ideas for names, but we settled on Wick. We imagined our app as the torch that accompanied users on their path to self-improvement. Wick was a short and catchy name that immediately brought the image of fire to mind. We chose a font with an earthy, grounded, rugged feel.</p>

      <p>In developing our brand, we kept returning to the words “Journey” and “Adventure.” Most of us had played the game “Firewatch” and were inspired by its warm and exciting feelings of adventure and immersion in nature. We selected cool greens and blues in contrast to the yellow and orange CTAs to communicate this.</p>

      <p>Our language was down-to-earth, comforting, and empathetic. The sans-serif font was modern enough for a self-help app but still resembled fonts used in state parks and on hiking trails. We incorporated a fire motif into our logo, with the flame resting in the crossed arms of the W, like a fire brazier.</p>

      <h2>UX Design</h2>

      <p>After creating personas from the data collected in our user interviews, we would whiteboard flows and wireframes that attempted to accommodate all of the personas at once. As gamification introduces complexity into the experience and the app learning process, this seemed like the best approach, as it flattened and streamlined the experience.</p>
      <p>We also created a detailed wireframe in Figma that incorporated our approved whiteboard designs. This allowed us to iterate and ideate quickly, and only spend larger amounts of time and energy on fleshed-out ideas.</p>
      <p>Prototyping this new complete lo-fi allowed us to test the app remotely with our original user interview group. This provided many valuable insights as having them step through the app and speak their thoughts aloud revealed pain points that we stamped out before the hi-fi prototype, and also revealed new insights or ideas, some of which were incorporated into the final design.</p>

      <h2>UI Design</h2>

      <p>Part of our visual language included beautifully illustrated visuals throughout the entire app and iconography related to camping and adventure. We encouraged repeat app usage by awarding points for completing tasks (with weighted rewards based on the difficulty of the task) and earning badges. This melded well with the friendly writing tone and positive encouragement throughout the app.</p>

      <p>Next, we mocked up the high-resolution designs for each screen in the user flow. We fleshed out every possible user state identified in our lo-fi prototype and brought it to life using our established visual language. Using Adobe XD, we created an interactive hi-fi prototype for final testing before development.</p>
