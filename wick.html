      <h3>Case Study</h3>
      <h2>Wick</h2>
    </section>

    <article>
      <p>At OddOwls LLC, Wick was all about making achieving your well-being goals easy and fun, which brought us to
        gamification. It encapsulated not only our desire to create something that will actually help people, but also
        highlighted our focus on it being a shared journey.</p>
      <p>We landed on the tagline “An adventure to a better you,” and a mission statement of “To make the journey of
        self-improvement fun, simple, and accessible.” </p>

    <article>
      <p>We conducted some <strong>competitive research</strong> on the top 25 competing apps in the Health and Wellness space, including
        a <strong>SWOT</strong> analysis that analyzed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats from their existing user
        experiences, features, flows, visual language and UI patterns.</p>

      <p>We found that a majority of them employed a similar <strong>visual language</strong>, they primarily used a clean, minimal
        aesthetic. We also found a lack of robust gamification which excited us about providing for that niche.</p>

      <p>We created <strong>personas</strong> based on who our ideal user would be. After narrowing down to 3 different persona types,
        including our core target group of adults aged between 19-40 years old, and at different stages of their
        well-being journeys, we reached out to them for <strong>phone interviews.</strong></p>

      <p>We collected <strong>quantitative and qualitative data</strong> ranging from device type, hourly usage, number of existing or
        previously used health apps, to which self help/health behaviors they engage in and for how long, and gauged
        interest in such an app.</p>

      <p>We asked if they would ever consider using an application like ours, what they thought their most important
        positive habits were, and more. We found that they had an overall lack of interest in repetitive and “boring”
        interactions with the applications they have been using.</p>

    <h1 data-aos="fade-left">UX Design</h1>
    <img src="images/showcase/wick/prototype.png" alt="Wick Prototype" />

    <article>
      <p>There were many ideas for <strong>names</strong>, but we settled on Wick. We imagined our app being the torch that accompanied
        you on the path to self-improvement. Wick was a short and catchy name that immediately brought the image of fire
        into our minds. We chose a font that had an earthy, grounded, rugged feel.</p>

      <p>When thinking about what our <strong>brand</strong> should be, we kept coming back to the
        words, “Journey,” and, “Adventure.” Most of us had played the game “Firewatch”, and were inspired by the warm
        and exciting feelings of adventure, connection to and immersion in nature. Cool greens and blues were selected
        in contrast to the yellow and orange CTAs to communicate this.</p>

      <p>The <strong>language</strong> was down to earth, comforting and empathetic. The sans-serif was modern enough to not look out of
        place in a self-help app, but still resembled the fonts used in state parks and hiking trails. We knew we had to
        have some form of a fire motif in our <strong>logo</strong>. We settled on having the flame rest in the crossed arms of the W,
        like a fire brazier.</p>

      <p>Once we established our relative <strong>user flows</strong>, we created moved onto <strong>wire-framing</strong>, and then to a <strong>lo-fi mockups</strong>
        and a <strong>lo-fi interactive prototype</strong> for testing. We came up with a Design System for every <strong>UI component</strong> within the app.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Part of our <strong>visual language</strong> was having beautifully <strong>illustrated visuals</strong> throughout the entire app and using
        iconography related to camping and adventure. We encouraging repeat app uses through getting points for
        completing tasks (with weighted rewards based on the difficulty of the task) and earning badges. Which melded
        well with the friendly writing <strong>tone</strong> and positive encouragement throughout the process of use.</p>

      <p>Next was mocking up the <strong>igh-resolution design</strong>h for each screen in the user flow. We fleshed out every
        possible use state identified in our lo-fi prototype and gave visual life to it using our established visual
        language. Using Adobe XD, we created an <strong>interactive hi-fi prototype</strong> for use in final testing before development.
