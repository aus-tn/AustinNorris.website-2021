                <h1>NASCAR</h1>
            </div>

            <img src="assets/images/cases/nascar/featured.png" alt="NASCAR">

            <p>The sanctioning body for stock-car racing in North America was founded in 1948 in Daytona Beach, Florida.
                It is responsible for making stock-car racing a widely popular sport in the United States by the turn of
                the 21st century.</p>
            <p>I performed UI development and design for NASCAR.com and IMSA updates, as well as created websites for
                their managed properties and clients, including NASCAR Mexico, Sebring Raceway, and ARCA Menards.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>


            <p>My work started with creative briefings with the product manager and assigned designer. These briefings
                informed me of the research findings so that any design modifications were as informed as possible.</p>
            <p>I would submit design modification recommendations for review by the product manager, client, designer,
                and other stakeholders. Once all parties signed off, development began.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>

            <p>The designers I worked with were repurposed graphic designers, so guidance for working with the web was
                very important to ensure accessibility, usability, and industry-standard practices were applied,
                ensuring the quality of the experience and interface.</p>
            <p>We'd go through revisions until the designer and I felt the designs were complete for product manager and
                client/stakeholder sign-off.</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>


            <p>I utilized, modified, and added to their existing custom WordPress theme and plugins. The websites I
                created were assigned solely to me. I'd work within their Atlassian system (Jira) to update the project
                as it was completed. Tickets were separated by page or major feature.</p>
            <p>I worked in sync with the product owner and designer to execute the client's requirements while adhering
                to proper practices to ensure the quality of the product. If any issues were found during QA, the ticket
                would be reassigned to me for bug fixes or requested modifications.</p>
            <p>During major races and events, which usually occurred on the weekend, only one live ops team member and I
                would occupy the 8th floor of the NASCAR building in downtown Charlotte. We'd be on standby while
                monitoring the race so I could correct any issues with the website, especially the live race tracking
                metrics.</p>
